#  Mr. Random's Mini Game Website

Welcome to **Mr. Random's** personal corner of the internet — a glowing, interactive website where story meets code.

## About Mr. Random

Once a normal programmer, Mr. Random discovered the unpredictable beauty of randomness while debugging a Python game. From flipping coins to generating names and numbers, he found joy in every spontaneous outcome.

This website is a tribute to that journey — combining storytelling, creativity, and mini-games built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
